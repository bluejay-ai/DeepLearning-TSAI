Assignment:

**We have considered many many points in our last 4 lectures. 
Some of these we have covered directly and some indirectly. They are:**
1. How many layers,
2. MaxPooling,
3. 1x1 Convolutions,
4. 3x3 Convolutions,
5. Receptive Field,
6. SoftMax,
7. Learning Rate,
8. Kernels and how do we decide the number of kernels?
9. Batch Normalization,
10. Image Normalization,
11. Position of MaxPooling,
12. Concept of Transition Layers,
13. Position of Transition Layer,
14. Number of Epochs and when to increase them,
15. DropOut
16. When do we introduce DropOut, or when do we know we have some overfitting
17. The distance of MaxPooling from Prediction,
18. The distance of Batch Normalization from Prediction,
19. When do we stop convolutions and go ahead with a larger kernel or some other alternative (which we have not yet covered)
20. How do we know our network is not going well, comparatively, very early
21. Batch Size, and effects of batch size
22. When to add validation checks
23. LR schedule and concept behind it
24. Adam vs SGD
etc (you can add more if we missed it here)

**As we have gone through the 7 code files above, we'd like you to develop an intuition on when to introduce these. We would never want to start with everything enabled (maybe for atleast 8-9 sessions). Considering that, we want to think about these things in order, we would like you to:
Write your Assignment 3 again such that:
Finally after 4 code iterations achieve:**
-- 99.4% accuracy
-- Less than 15k Parameters
-- Have started from a Vanilla network (no BN, DropOut, LR, larger batch size, change in Optimizer, etc)

I) Make sure you are tracking your code's performance, and writing down your observations are you achieve better or worse results

II) Your second code can only have max 2 improvements over first one, third can have only max 2 over second and so on. 

III) All of your iterations are in different CODE BLOCKS and named properly like First CODE, Second CODE, etc

IV) All of your iterations have a Header note, describing what all you are planning to do in this code

V) All of your code is very well documented

VI) There is a readme file (or embedded documentation) describing your codes and steps you've taken

VII) This is a slightly time-consuming assignment, please make sure you start early. 

VIII) 200 points on your code and Documentation, and 200 points on your ReadMe File or Documentation. (Subtractions in case your readme or documentation does not have proper formatting and does not look formal/professional)

IX) You are submitting 1 file with 4 codes (and a readme if you do not want to comment directly in the file)
